# ComputerVisionTool
Grad school project, Visual Studio based. may need refactoring

This is a gui utility with several computer vision functions including a bilateral filter, an edge detector, a gaussian filter, as well as a kmeans algorithm developed for pixel space. All development was done as part of a computer vision class in grad school. Please contribute new algorithms! Currently only runs for Visual Studio 2010 I believe. All updates are welcome!

## Images
All functionality was designed and tested using the images provided in images/ 

## Etc
May need refactoring to run. The outer folder name used to be Project4.. Do not currently have time to make further improvements..
